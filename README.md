[pledged_patents.zip](pledged_patents.zip)

This is the dataset of pledged patents that I used in [Mann (JFE 2018)](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2018.07.001), constructed from the documents available online at the time from Google Patents and the USPTO. The dataset ends in 2013 and is provided here primarily for historical documentation. There are now much more convenient tools available to assemble the same data and extend it to the present day. In particular, Google now hosts the Google Patents data as a public dataset within Google Cloud BigQuery, which allows researchers to query and join the underlying patent tables directly using SQL, without needing to download, parse, or manage raw XML files. Researchers interested in extending this dataset or constructing related patent samples are strongly encouraged to use this approach.
